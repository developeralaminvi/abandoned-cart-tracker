## üß© Description

The **Abandoned Cart Tracker** plugin for WooCommerce helps store owners recover lost sales by tracking customer data and cart details from abandoned checkouts.

When a customer fills out the checkout form but doesn‚Äôt complete the purchase, their information and cart contents are automatically saved and displayed in the WordPress admin dashboard.

### Manual Database Fixes

If you're upgrading from an older version and encounter issues:

```sql
-- Add missing is_viewed column (if needed)
ALTER TABLE wp_abandoned_carts ADD COLUMN is_viewed tinyint(1) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;

-- Update existing records
UPDATE wp_abandoned_carts SET is_viewed = 0 WHERE is_viewed IS NULL;

-- Add performance indexes (if missing)
ALTER TABLE wp_abandoned_carts ADD INDEX idx_session_status (session_id, status);
ALTER TABLE wp_abandoned_carts ADD INDEX idx_user_status (user_id, status);
ALTER TABLE wp_abandoned_carts ADD INDEX idx_checkout_time (checkout_time);
ALTER TABLE wp_abandoned_carts ADD INDEX idx_status_viewed (status, is_viewed);

## üß© Description

The **Abandoned Cart Tracker** plugin for WooCommerce helps store owners recover lost sales by tracking customer data and cart details from abandoned checkouts.

When a customer fills out the checkout form but doesn‚Äôt complete the purchase, their information and cart contents are automatically saved and displayed in the WordPress admin dashboard.

If the customer completes the order later, the entry is automatically removed from the abandoned list.
